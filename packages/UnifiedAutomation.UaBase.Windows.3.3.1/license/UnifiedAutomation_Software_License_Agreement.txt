Use Definition2.1 Authorization of UsageLicensee acknowledges that Unified Automation is the sole owner of all rights in the SOFTWARE and in all of the know-how pertaining to this SOFTWARE except those described in Appendix A. It shall forbear to attack the rights of Unified Automation, unless Unified Automation asserts such rights against Licensee or Licensee attacks a patent or patent application (or similar, patent-related rights such as utility models) of Unified Automation. It will adequately inform third parties of Unified Automation's ownership of those rights.Licensee shall only be granted a limited right of usage to the extent to which it is absolutely necessary for the purposes of this agreement. The provisions following hereunder are characterizations of this principle and shall be narrowly construed in cases of doubt. Unified Automation's copyright of the SOFTWARE shall not be exhausted by this agreement. Nothing in this provision shall be construed in a way as to prevent Licensee from defending its rights in case Unified Automation infringes Licensee patents, trademarks or copyrights, or misappropriates Licensee's trade secrets.The SOFTWARE may not be leased, assigned, or sublicensed, in whole or in part if and to the extent not expressly permitted in Section 1 ("Grant of License") above. You may not make accessible the SOFTWARE to third parties and you must make sure that no one except your authorized Licensee has access to the computer(s) where the SOFTWARE is installed. ===============================================================================2.2 Transfer of Use AuthorizationOn written request by Licensee and upon prior authorization by Unified Automation, Licensee may transfer the single seat developer license granted under Section 1.3 and/ or 1.4 above permanently/temporarily to an affiliate or external subcontractor and assign another developer than the one originally designated. Licensee's request must indicate the name, email address and full company postal address of the new developer and the reason for the requested transfer. Reason for temporarily transferred license must define a particular contracted development project of a component or product of the Licensee and a period of duration within valid maintenance subscription of the SOFTWARE. After written approval the Licensee is allowed to give the assignee - of this particular development project - access to the SOFTWARE while acting on account of and in the name of Licensee. The Licensee must insure that such external development partner is following all rules of the SLA and that the development partner is not using the SOFTWARE for any other purpose than this particular development project with the Licensee. The rights of the recent developer to use the SOFTWARE cease upon Unified Automation's consent to the transfer. On written request by Licensee and upon prior authorization by Unified Automation, Licensee may transfer the single product development license by changing the registered name and OPC UA Product URI of the end user product the license granted under Section 1.5 was originally purchased for. On such transfer the license granted under Section 1.5 above is permanently assigned to the new end user product's name and OPC UA Product URI. The development rights and the distribution allowance of the recent end-user product containing the SOFTWARE cease upon Unified Automation's consent to the transfer. Unified Automation remains the right to refuse such transfer for good cause. The written consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, i.e. transferring to a direct competitor of Unified Automation, insufficient license identification criteria, or renaming to an already registered name, or insufficient uniqueness of OPC UA Product URI causes reasonable refuse.Each transfer of a license temporarily or permanently and/or each re-assignment of use rights may incur an additional transfer fee.===============================================================================2.3 Scope of UsageThe SOFTWARE is "in use" on a computer when it is loaded into temporary memory (i.e. RAM) or installed into permanent memory (e.g. hard disk, CD-ROM, or other storage device) of that computer, except that a copy installed on a network server for the sole purpose of distribution to other computers (e.g. file share, backup) is not "in use". ===============================================================================2.4 Active Development and SCM PermissionFor the developer license granted under Section 1.3 and/ or 1.4 and/ or 1.5 above, the authorization of use encloses the "active development", which is the intellectual process of writing code that uses the SOFTWARE, including but not limited to programming against the SOFTWARE's interfaces and compiling and/or linking the SOFTWARE's libraries. E.g. an automated buildbot would compile the SOFTWARE, but would not use it in the scope of "active development" and hence does not require a license.Licensee may enter the source code and/or object code of the SOFTWARE into a software change management system (e.g. such as IBM Rational ClearCase, CVS or GIT repository), which will allow the source code and/or object code to be viewed by unlicensed developers (e.g. for the purpose of static code analysis or security review). The foregoing is not a violation of this Agreement as long as no "active development" (i.e. programming against the SOFTWARE's API) is performed, and as long as the confidentiality of the SOFTWARE's source code and related information is protected using the same degree of care used to protect Licensees own similar proprietary and confidential information.===============================================================================3. RestrictionsThe SOFTWARE is confidential copyrighted information of Unified Automation and title to all copies is retained by Unified Automation and/or its licensors. Licensee shall not combine or link the SOFTWARE with open source software or components, if that joint work forces appliance of terms and conditions of such open source license on the SOFTWARE itself or portions thereof which are contradicting with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Licensee shall not decompile, disassemble, decrypt, extract, or otherwise reverse engineer the SOFTWARE. As an exception to the forgoing, modification of the SOFTWARE and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications are permitted for the own use of Licensee and the customer of the licensee, narrowed to the minimum required for dynamically linking with LGPLv2.1 licensed GNU C-Library. In any case, it is prohibited to share any findings due to Reverse Engineering with any third party and it is prohibited to distribute modified version of the SOFTWARE. All warranty rights cease on modification of the SOFTWARE.SOFTWARE is not designed or intended for use in critical safety systems including but not limited to nuclear facilities or activity, production of land mines or cluster bombs, aircraft communication and aircraft control systems, life critical healthcare systems or any life-support equipment or other situations in which case of failure of the SOFTWARE could lead to radiation, chemical and environmental damages, injury and contamination as well as death, personal injury or severe physical damages as well as death. The Licensee has sole responsibility for designing and implementing a solution making use of the licensed SOFTWARE which will meet all appropriate safety requirements and/or standards. Unified Automation disclaims all liability for any damages arising as a result of any non-conformance of the solution of the Licensee to safety requirements and/or standards. Unified Automation further disclaims all liability for any damages resulting from dangerous use or misuse of its licensed SOFTWARE. Licensee shall indemnify, hold harmless and Unified Automation and its suppliers and Unified Automation's and its suppliers respective officers, directors, employees and agents (each an "Indemnified Party") from against any damages, fines, penalties, assessments, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs) in the event that any claim is brought against any Indemnified Party arising from your dangerous use of the SOFTWARE from all liability resulting from such use(s), whether based on contract, warranty, tort (including negligence), strict liability or any other legal theory, regardless of whether Unified Automation had knowledge of the possibility of such damages or not.===============================================================================4.

For this, Licensee will enable Unified Automation to access the project showing the corresponding failure, especially via a remote access or the making available of projects, which can be used in the development environment of Unified Automation in order to clearly reproduce the corresponding failure.The parties agree that Class1 failures include the following cases:- serious defects, massive functional limitations especially in the final product at customer installations, e.g. system crash, hang-ups, data corruptionThe parties agree that Class2 failures include the following cases:- defects, functional limitations in assured functionality that could not be bypassed or avoided, e.g. by means of auxiliary functions, as well as uncontrolled memory and/or resource consumption, which will cause functional limitations in the long termFailures which, irrespective of their classification, are a result of incorrect use and/or use outside the conditions recommended by Unified Automation (as described in the documentation and the example code) will be eliminated by Unified Automation upon written request of Licensee and compensated using the common Unified Automation cost rates.===============================================================================6. Limitation of LiabilityThe SOFTWARE and components are not intended to replace the professional skills and judgment of Licensee and its employees, agents and consultants. Licensee alone shall be responsible for the accuracy and adequacy of information and data furnished for processing and any use made by Licensee of the output of the SOFTWARE or any reliance thereon. Unified Automation shall be liable towards Licensee to the fullest extent according to the statutory provisions.a. in the event of damages caused by wilful misconduct or gross negligence according of Unified Automation, its representatives or employees;b. in case of damages resulting in death or personal injury;c. to the extent that Unified Automation have expressly given a guarantee or accepted to bear a procurement risk;d. in the event of liability under the German Product Liability Act ("Produkthaftungsgesetz").Beyond a) to d) above, Unified Automation shall only be liable to Licensee in the event of damages caused by a negligent breach of a material contractual obligation. Unified Automation's liability shall, however, in this case be limited to the typical, foreseeable damage. If possible by applicable law, Unified Automation's entire liability to Licensee and Licensee's exclusive remedy shall be, at Unified Automation's option, either (A) return of the price Licensee paid for the licensed SOFTWARE, or (B) repair or replacement of the licensed SOFTWARE.All further liability shall be excluded. The SOFTWARE or the use of the SOFTWARE may be subject to regulatory provisions related to products used in the Health Care Industry. Prior to using the SOFTWARE, it is Licensee's responsibility to ensure that Licensee's use of the SOFTWARE will not violate any legal or regulatory provisions nor deviate from the conditions intended for the use of the SOFTWARE as explained in the user documentation.===============================================================================7. IndemnificationYou expressly acknowledge and agree that although Unified Automation grants the licenses to their SOFTWARE set forth herein, no assurances are provided by Unified Automation that certain configuration of the SOFTWARE or the use for a specific purpose does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Unified Automation disclaims any liability to you for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, you hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow you to use the SOFTWARE for a certain purpose or specific use case, it is your responsibility to acquire that license before distributing or using the SOFTWARE.If notified promptly in writing of any action (and provided that Unified Automation has been promptly notified of all prior claims relating to such action) brought against Licensee based on a claim that the unaltered release of the SOFTWARE infringes a third party patent or copyright, Unified Automation shall, upon request of Licensee, defend such action at its expense including attorneys' fees and expert fees and pay any costs or damages finally awarded in such action which are attributable to such claim, provided that Unified Automation shall have sole control of the defense of any such action and of all negotiations for its settlement or compromise. United Automation shall not be obliged to defend such action if the infringement is based on a prior version of the SOFTWARE, the infringement has been fixed in the current version and Unified Automation has offered a free-of-charge update to Licensee before the claim arose.If a final injunction is obtained against Licensee of any of the SOFTWARE by reason of infringement of a patent or copyright, or if in Unified Automation's opinion any of the SOFTWARE supplied to Licensee hereunder is likely to become the subject of a successful claim of infringement of a patent or copyright, Unified Automation shall, at its option and expense, either procure for Licensee the right to continue using such SOFTWARE or replace or modify the same so that it becomes non-infringing or, if neither of the above options is commercially reasonable, Unified Automation will grant Licensee a full refund for such SOFTWARE and accept their return. All rights of Licensee under the license granted according to this Agreement shall cease upon the return of the SOFTWARE.Notwithstanding the foregoing, Unified Automation shall not have any liability to Licensee under this Section if the infringement or claim is based upon the use of any of the SOFTWARE in combination with other equipment or software which is not furnished by Unified Automation (if such claim would have been avoided in case the SOFTWARE was not in such combination, including but not limited to the combination with Third-Party components listed in Appendix A), SOFTWARE which have been modified or altered by Licensee if the SOFTWARE would not infringe but for the modification or alteration or if intellectual property rights owned by Licensee, the relevant customer or any of their respective affiliates.Nothing in the forgoing shall prevent the Licensee at its option and expense to defend itself against claims brought against his end user products that are based on or make use of the SOFTWARE independent of a certain use case of such end user products or to procure the respective rights or to replace or modify theSOFTWARE so that it becomes non-infringing.===============================================================================8. TerminationThe License shall be for a period commencing upon the date of initial download or delivery of the SOFTWARE and continuing until such time this agreement is terminated in accordance with this agreement, but otherwise without limitation as to duration. Unified Automation shall have the right to terminate this agreement if Licensee fails to pay any required license fee(s) or otherwise fails to comply with the license terms and conditions described in Section 1.

Even though some platforms do provide good Unicode text handling services, portable application code can not make use of them. The ICU4C libraries fills in this gap. ICU4C provides an open, flexible, portable foundation for applications to use for their software globalization requirements. ICU4C closely tracks industry standards, including Unicode and CLDR (Common Locale Data Repository). The ICU license is intended to allow ICU to be included both in free software projects and in proprietary or commercial products. Since ICU 58, ICU is covered by the Unicode license which is very similar to the previous ICU license.8.1 CopyrightCopyright (c) 1991-2022 Unicode, Inc.

It can be easily integrated into resource-limited or embedded projects. Most JSON parsers offer you a bunch of functions to load JSON data, parse it and extract any value by its name. jsmn proves that checking the correctness of every JSON packet or allocating temporary objects to store parsed JSON fields often is an overkill.9.1 CopyrightCopyright (c) 2010 Serge A.
